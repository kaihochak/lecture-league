## Description

**Lecture League** is a dynamic and responsive web application that serves as a platform for students to review and rate academic courses. This project is an evolution of **the original "Rate My Course" app**, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mrmallam/Rate_My_Course). My contribution to this earlier version was primarily focused on the backend development, along with frontend features such as the search bar and API services.

The inception was driven by a pressing need to address the time constraints that impacted our earlier design. The original version, while functional, had several frontend aspects that we couldn't fully develop due to limited time. Recognizing this, I spearheaded a comprehensive redesign of the frontend, with a specific focus on enhancing the user experience and interface. This redesign wasn't just an aesthetic overhaul; it was a strategic move to incorporate and complete the essential frontend features that our team initially envisioned but couldn't implement.

In Lecture League, the user experience and interface have been reimagined and executed with a high level of precision and attention to detail, making the application more intuitive and user-friendly. Further information about the specific UX/UI improvements can be found in the "Usage" section of this documentation.

The tech stack for Lecture League includes React JS, Tailwind CSS, Django, and SQLite, creating a robust and scalable application. The primary aim of the app remains to serve as a platform for students to review and discuss academic courses, fostering a collaborative and informed educational community.

For deployment purposes, Lecture League is fully containerized using Docker, segregated into Frontend, Backend, and NGINX containers. This setup ensures efficient deployment and scalability.
